	* Version 2.0 merged from spiral_graph branch to master.
	* API revamped to implement the functionality included in GraphBLAS C
	API spec
	* All algorithms revamped to be more "GraphBLAS-ified".  Maxflow
	still needs additional conversion.
	* Support for GPU backend removed.
	* Build system switched from autotools to cmake.

2016-04-25
	* implemented mxm masking in cusp
	* fixed ewisemult issue
	* fixed ewisemult and mxm tests
	* fixed negation tests
	* all basic functionalities described in M2 completed.
2016-04-18
	* fixed extract and assign operations (passing tests) in cusp
	* fixed reduction operations and implemented masked reduction operations
2016-04-15
	* fixed dimension checks on the frontend
	* implemented == operator on cusp backend matrices
	* fixed some issues in reduce, extract, assign
2016-04-04
	* cusp::NegateView implemented
	* cusp::pretty_print_matrix implemented to support frontend matrix_util::print_matrix
	* implemented (get,set)_value_at on the cusp backend

2016-03-30
	* added files for compilation
	* added vector concept (dense vector)
	* cusp::buildmatrix filtering duplicate entries
	* added utility::filter convenience method
	* removed ConstantMatrix from both backends and replaced with apply
	* implemented TransposeView in cusp

2016-02-14
	* Version 0.1 released; CUSP and sequential backends (except for
	  support of "views" like TransposeView, NegateView, "extended" views).

2015-09-30 Scott McMillan <smcmillan@sei.cmu.edu>
	* Alpha release of GraphBLAS API (WIP)
	* Alpha release of graph algorithms suite
	* Alpha release of GPU backend built on Cusp and Thrust (and a proof
	  of concept release of a simple, naive sequential backend for CPU)
  
2015-07-16 John Matty <jcmatty@sei.cmu.edu>
	* Everything: Initial prototyping.
